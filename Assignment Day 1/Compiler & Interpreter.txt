Assignment Day 1 - Java Zero to Hero

Q1. Difference between Compiler and Interpreter ?
A1. The following is the differenciation of compiler and interpreter:-
	1. Compiler coverts the code wriiten in high level language  and then into 
	   the machine code at once i.e into binary(0 & 1), whereas interpreter 
	   converts each high level statement one by one into machine code during 
	   the program run.
	2. Due to this Compiled code runs faster in comparison to the interpreted code
	3. Compiler display all the errors at once after completing the compilation 
	   whereas interpreter displays error of each line one by one.
	4. Compiler compiles an entire program at once where as Interpreter interprets
 	   the program line by line.

	Workflow:
	1. Compiler:
	   
		Source Code -> Compiler -> Machine Code -> Output

	2. Interpreter:

		Source Code -> Interpreter -> Output
